 * - When the request is directed at /cms
 * - Unless it's a forbidden pattern (aka a Wagtail preview page, which we want
 *   to render on Nuxt side like a regular CMS page, even though it's within the
 *   admin)
 * - Unless (lol) it's a POST request, in which case we want it to go through
 *   the proxy because that's how Wagtail communicates the content of its
 *   previews
 *
 * An optimization in production is to configure the load balancer to always
 * send requests targeting /back to the API.
